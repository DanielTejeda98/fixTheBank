# FixTheBank Server and Client App

**A free and private place for tracking your budget.**

FixTheBank was born from the need to keep track of one's budget in a private and free (as long as you have the equipment to run it) way. It was built with the idea of sharing a budget with a household/partner.

## What makes FixTheBank awesome?
* **Private access to your data** No one owns your data except you. No third party is getting to see how you spend your money, or what you are saving for.
* **Sharing Budgets** You can share a budget that you own with a partner, household, or a group.
